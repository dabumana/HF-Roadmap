            "In antiquity, Homer's authorship was taken as true, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently, forming as part of long oral traditions. Given widespread illiteracy, the poem was performed for an audience by an aoidos or rhapsode. Odyssey, epic poem in 24 books traditionally attributed to the ancient Greek poet Homer. The poem is the story of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, who wanders for 10 years (although the action of the poem covers only the final six weeks) trying to get home after the Trojan War. Learn more about the Odyssey. Discover Homer, the Greek poet known for The Iliad and The Odyssey. Explore his life, age, legacy, and his impact on literature and culture. Homer was a famous Greek poet known for epic tales like the Iliad and the Odyssey. Many think Homer was blind, and his name might mean 'blind' or 'captive' in ancient Greek. Homer's poems offer insights into Greek myth, religion, and the Trojan War, influencing literature and ethics. The Odyssey was written by Homer, an ancient Greek poet, and it tells the story of Odysseus' journey home after the Trojan War. This epic poem is composed of 24 books and explores themes of identity and the importance of home. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Homer.\n"
